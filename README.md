# Assumptions of linear regression model
While Building our Linear Regression Model we have some assumptions which we need to keep in our mind to better regression line fit. Linear Regression is supervised machine Learning Algorithm in which one or more independent variable explain the dependent(Predictor) variable. There linear regression have some assumptions which will be checked

 1- Linearity
 2- Multicollinearity
 3- mean of residuals
 4- normality of residuals
 5- Error Term should be independent to each other
 6- hemoscedasticity / heteroscedasticity
